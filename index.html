                <p>Kill is a multi-media character of the arts, inspired by vintage ninja movies on VHS and Ninja Gaiden on the Nintendo Entertainment System (<a href="images/ninjagaiden.jpg" data-lightbox="ninjagaiden">Cover art</a>). He was created in 1994 when I, the artist Michael Nguyen (<a href="https://spiritsoftheuniverse.github.io/michaelnguyenart">Visit the site</a>) was in 6th grade (<a href="images/classpicture.jpg" data-lightbox="classpicture">Photo</a>).</p>
                <p>
                        Originally a comic book zine character of light-hearted gore and violence, Kill is now seen in original works, art prints, apparel, and his own video game called &quot;Kill&quot;. 
                        While still light-heartedly violent in nature, Kill is also represented in cultural mingling and studies of humanity. He is a catalyst for art which reflects those who are a part of my life.

                <p class="phead">Introduction </p>
                <p class="pindent">Kill the video game is a single player adventure from the classic 2d side view perspective, albeit with evolving modern 3d graphical technology of the Unreal Engine. It has very specific goals that do not exist in the modern era of commercial video game production.</p>
                
                <p class="phead">Player Execution </p>
                <p class="pindent">At the height of gaming from an execution standpoint, there was a congruency between flashiness and difficulty of execution. Execution refers to your technical ability of pressing buttons in order to perform the actions that appear on the screen. It is similar to guitar playing, where it requires an adequate amount of finger dexterity to gracefully produce listenable sound. The problem with video games today is the shoe-horning of the spectacle in place of skill based button pressing. Shoe horning the spectacle involves making flashy activity easy to do, which is very contradictory to what flashiness truly entails. Figure skating for example requires vigorous practice to become an olympian level competitor. As time went on, game developers decided to make it easy to do flashy things, taking away from the accomplishment of participating in the activity while at the same time having everyone take for granted what they're seeing and doing. It is already difficult enough to get people to acknowledge that you can be a graceful mental athlete in the world of gaming, but the modern take on the spectacle has made it impossible to take it seriously, because if everyone can do it immediately, then there is no true spectacle to speak of. It's all superficial. Not only that, most games don't even have a spectacle component to begin with. They are now tailored for the masses, therefore are paced at a rate which is much more comprehensible to the average spectator. There are no longer video games where there are truly super-human activities happening on the screen. Not even indie games supply such a thing. People who understand the beauty of true execution pay their respect to those who can do it. Among the entire population of gamers, the ones who understand it the most are the Marvel and Capcom fighting game community (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unt0ivAkV7c">video</a>). That is why I paid my respects to them in full before nomadically roaming back to my artistic endeavors.</p>

                        While bringing heightened skill in execution back is one of the goals, all of Kill's abilities are not actually hard to do at all. All the button pressing is easy unlike older Marvel and Capcom fighting games, but the activity of juggling opponents in the air is what is difficult about it. It strikes the healthiest balance between being inviting to new players while also having something to strive for. Knowing this, the art and activity of juggling opponents in the air is entirely optional. There are no rewards for doing it, nor are there any numerical counters to tell you how many hits you did before you drop your opponent. There is no score keeping of any kind on the heads up display. Not only that, there is no end goal to the game. When you leave an area and come back, everything is reset as if nothing ever happened so that you can further experiment with your gameplay curiosities. And that is the point of the game, to provide a playground for those who are curious to play and not be overly concerned with being rewarded for their accomplishments. Video games have always littered doggy treats as an incentive for people to keep on playing. There are certainly rewards in Kill the video game for accomplishing certain things, but the point is not to treat you like a dog. It is to add a little bit more to your optional utility belt. The game in its entirety does not demand that you accomplish anything at all. You can see most of the whole world without defeating anyone or completing a challenging obstacle. So, while this game gives you the option to play like a super-human, you can enjoy the sights of its universe without any technical ability at all as long as you don't wander into a place that is a bit too dangerous for your capabilities. But for those who are curious, it's all there for you to enjoy.

                <p class="phead">Reflection of Life</p>
                <p class="pindent">
                        To some degree, everything we create reflects life in some sort of way. Kill the video game however is taking a different approach to this, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy in a more peculiar way. The 2d side view already makes no sense whatsoever, so turning it into a dreamscape makes more sense than trying to bring logicality to it. Within this dreamscape are intermittent areas of intimate moments. The game starts off in a foresty area with a tree house and campfire. This area represents the my online establishment at Patreon, the Treehouse Studio (<a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/michaelsArtwork">Visit Patreon</a>), being the place where I share  creative progress to my audience. The campfire represents my youtube productions where I sit beside you and provide life stories, updates on what is going on, while also highlighting any community activities which have happened since the last campfire video. Having the treehouse and the campfire in the Kill video game allows me to playfully show the game off in my youtube videos within context.

                <p class="pindent">
                        Due to the game not being narratively driven, it is very easy to bring the people and cultures of my life into the game wherever it may fit. A prime example would be the Marvel vs. Capcom player Ch0l0Maquiner0. Aside from being a great fighting game player, he went to a Metallica concert with another great player named mrfreeze360. Ch0l0Maquiner0's name roughly translates to indigenous machinist, so in Kill's universe, there will surely be a hispanic machinist out there listening to metal with his friend who can cast ice magic. I don't even know Ch0l0Maquiner0 personally, so it'll only be more monumental when people who have been a greater part of my life are included.
                </p>
                <p class="pindent">
                        Not only is it a thing to include people who have been a part of my life, I am always seeking the opportunity to enlighten myself to any degree possible about cultures around the world, and music is usually the primer. I am unfamiliar with the modern political context of the buzzwords being tossed around such as inclusion and representation, so my means of inclusion and representation in the universe of Kill are simply to include and represent people whenever I get the chance to.
                </p>
                <p class="phead">Intent of Play</p>
                <p class="pindent">
                        While it is up to you to determine what playing the game means to you, the intent of bringing this play medium is not to provide an escape. I believe that the more you are present with the activity, the more you can get out of it, and that is true for anything. As mentioned in the Freedom passage, the higher skilled players will be able to find enjoyment in the technical play aspects of the game. It is important that this kind of play exists, because video games being made today that are not competitive are now inadvertently exclusionary to these kinds of players. Games that are difficult to arrive at the win condition are not what I am talking about when it comes to skilled play. Those games are challenging in their own way, but what I am emphasizing in the development of this game is the ability to express yourself gracefully through your movements and your offensive capabilities,whether the opponent or obstacle you are facing is challenging or not. Difficulty has little to do with the intent to express yourself gracefully.
                </p>
                <p class="pindent">
                        For those who have no intention to get good at video games and simply want to traverse this Universe, then surely you are invited to do so. Since the game is truly free from the trappings of a commercially released game and has no end goal or mandatory challenges to block your way, you can do whatever you want.
                </p>
                <p class="phead">Place in the Market</p>
                <p class="pindent">
                        As Kill is not intended to be a commercial game, it is treated as a transgressive piece of art that works against all of the regressions brought forth to us by modern gaming. With this in mind, it will not be released like a commercial video game. There might just be a playable build distributed in secret at any time. As there is no destined end to the game, there is no intention to end the development of the game either. As a result, marketing campaigns and related products can be created in perpetuity. This is in essence to the longevity of the Kill character, as he is now 30 years old as of 2024.
