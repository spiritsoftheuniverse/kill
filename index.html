                        <p>Kill is a multi-media character of the arts, inspired by vintage ninja movies on VHS and Ninja Gaiden on the Nintendo Entertainment System (<a href="images/ninjagaiden.jpg" data-lightbox="ninjagaiden">Cover art</a>). He was created in 1994 when I, the artist Michael Nguyen (<a href="https://spiritsoftheuniverse.github.io/michaelnguyenart">Visit the site</a>) was in 6th grade (<a href="images/classpicture.jpg" data-lightbox="classpicture">Photo</a>).</p>
                        <p>
                                Originally a comic book zine character of light-hearted gore and violence, Kill is now seen in original works, art prints, apparel, and his own video game called &quot;Kill&quot;. 
                                While still light-heartedly violent in nature, Kill is also represented in cultural mingling and studies of humanity. He is a catalyst for art which reflects those who are a part of my life.

                        <p class="pindent" style="margin-bottom:24px;">Kill the video game is a single player adventure from the classic 2d side view perspective. It is a transgressive piece of art that works against the regressions and trends of commercial video games.</p>
                </section>

                        <p class="phead">Player Execution </p>
                        <p class="pindent">At the height of gaming from a standpoint of technical play, there was congruency between beauty and difficulty of execution. Execution refers to button-pressing skills which perform the actions that appear on the screen. It is similar to guitar playing, where it requires an adequate amount of finger dexterity to gracefully articulate sound. Commercial games have been making visually pleasing activity easy to do, eliminating the need to practice and earn what you are capable of. Whether we realize it or not, the result of this has people taking for granted what they're seeing and doing. It is already difficult enough to get people to acknowledge that you can be a graceful mental athlete in the world of gaming, but the modern take on the spectacle has made it impossible to take it seriously due to the activity becoming more superficial. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="pindent" style="margin-bottom:24px;">
                        Those who understand the beauty of technical execution always pay their respects to those who can do it. Among the entire population of gamers, the ones who understand it the most are the Marvel and Capcom fighting game community (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unt0ivAkV7c">video</a>). That is why I paid my respects to them in full before nomadically roaming back to my artistic endeavors. They are otherwise unknown to the gaming population at large despite being the most gifted fighters and technique artists. This is sadly due to the fact that player execution is not of anyone's concern except for some of them and myself. We are a very special unit of players in the world of gaming.
                        </p>

                        Kill is not fundamentally hard to control. Timing discrepencies is where the difficulty factor is. The game strikes a balance between being inviting to new players while also having something to strive for. Much of Kill's core abilities are seen in other video games. On the other hand, he can transition from one maneuver or attack into the next seamlessly, moreso than any other character in video game history. This allows for the variance that is required for players to be able to express themselves in the world without limits. These abilities have been fine tuned across multiple game builds for years upon years.

                        <p class="pindent">
                                While it is up to you to determine what playing means to you, the intent of the game is not to provide an escape. I believe that the more you are present with the activity, the more you can get out of it, and that is true for anything. Higher skilled players will be able to find enjoyment in the technical aspects of the game. It is important that this kind of play exists, because video games are now inadvertently exclusionary to these kinds of players. We are completely unacknowledged. Games that are difficult to arrive at the win condition are not what I am talking about when it comes to skilled play. What I am emphasizing in the development of this game is the ability to express yourself gracefully through your movements and your offensive capabilities, whether the opponent or obstacle you are facing is challenging or not. There will be moments where you will need decision making skills to overcome the difficulty of resistance, although the emphasis is on the skills of overcoming difficulty in execution so that you can express yourself gracefully and non-superficially.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pindent">
                                The game is intended to be played in perpetuity just like the way I play the same games over and over again to no end. This is not created for people who think that it is over when you've seen all of the game's content. It is for players who never grow tired of the adventure or want something of depth to practice. The skill of juggling opponents in the air or acutely finessing your maneuverability is where the art is born, and it is entirely optional. There are no rewards for doing it, nor are there any numerical counters to tell you how many hits you did before you drop your opponent. There is no score keeping on the heads up display.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pindent">
                                There is no end goal to the game. When you leave an area and come back, everything is reset as if nothing ever happened so that you can further experiment with your gameplay curiosities.The game is your playground of infinity. It does not demand that you accomplish anything at all. It lets you be anywhere at any time, provided that you have already been there. All core maneuverability is available to you right from the start. You can see much of the world without defeating anyone or completing a challenging obstacle. While this game gives you the option to play with finesse, you can enjoy the sights of its universe without any technical ability as long as you don't wander into a dangerous place.

                        <p class="pindent">
                                To some degree, everything we create reflects life in some sort of way. The 2d side view is abstract, so turning it into a dreamscape makes more sense than trying to bring logicality to it. Within this dreamscape are intermittent areas of intimate moments. The game starts off in a foresty area with a tree house and campfire. This area represents my online establishment at Patreon, the Treehouse Studio (<a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/michaelsArtwork">Visit Patreon</a>), being the place where I share creative progress to my audience. The television in the treehouse represents my youtube productions where I sit beside you and provide life stories, updates on what is going on, while also highlighting any community activities that have happened since the last episode. Having the treehouse and the television in the Kill video game allows me to playfully show the game off in my youtube videos within context.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pindent" style="margin-bottom:24px;">
                                The game is not narratively driven. Instead, the spirit of the people in my life are drawn into the game. A curious example would be the Marvel vs. Capcom player Ch0l0Maquiner0. Aside from being a fighting game player, he went to a Metallica concert with another player named mrfreeze360. Ch0l0Maquiner0's name roughly translates to indigenous machinist, so in Kill's universe, there will surely be a hispanic machinist out there listening to metal with his friend who can cast ice magic while spinning in circles. I do not know Ch0l0Maquiner0 personally, but it does not take away from his influence. Not only is it a thing to include people who have been a part of my life, I am always seeking the opportunity to enlighten myself to any degree about various cultures and sub-cultures. This allows me to meaningfully colorize the personalities of the inhabitants within the Kill Universe.

                                This game is developed within the Unreal Engine, and it has been since 2013. Its concept has survived 3 major versions of the engine, on and off for over a decade. It has even been ported to lower end engines in failure, since they are not the place for a game of such artistry. Today, it sees the light of emerging technology which changes the way we create art in 3d space entirely. The classic 2d side view video game now has the opportunity to be rendered in a kind of fidelity never before possible. As the engine's technology evolves, Kill the video game evolves with it. It is only now where the creation of this game is truly possible, because the visual identity works together with the player's beautiful activities. 2d sprites have owned the beauty for the longest time in an artistic sense, and now 3d can step up to the plate.

                                As Kill is not intended to be a commercial video game, it will not be released like one. There might just be a playable build distributed in secret at any time. There will be no early access. There will be no play testing. The game just is. We learn how to play it together at the Treehouse Studio or in person with myself present in the room with you. As there is no destined end to the game, there is no intention to end its development. As a result, marketing campaigns and related products can be created in perpetuity. This is in essence to the longevity of the Kill character. He is now 30 years old as of 12/15/2024, the day in which this paper concluded its writing.

                                This project walks the line between personal and professional. It has fun taking itself very seriously. It's a game designed to let the under-served skillful player be very serious about the fun they have at every point of the adventure without excluding other players. At the same time, it celebrates the lives of the world's people, the history of video games, and other forms of media created by us.
