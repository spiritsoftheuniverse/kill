                <p>Kill is a multi-media character of the arts, inspired by vintage ninja movies on VHS and Ninja Gaiden on the Nintendo Entertainment System. He was created in 1994 when the artist Michael Nguyen (<a href="https://spiritsoftheuniverse.github.io/michaelnguyenart">Site</a>) was in 6th grade (Photo).</p>
                <p>
                        Originally a comic book zine character of light-hearted gore and violence, Kill is now seen in original works, art prints, apparel, and his own video game called &quot;Kill&quot;. 
                        While still light-heartedly violent in nature, Kill is also represented in cultural mingling and studies of humanity. He is a catalyst for art which reflects those who are a part of Michael's life.
