                <p>Kill is a multi-media character of the arts, inspired by vintage ninja movies on VHS and Ninja Gaiden on the Nintendo Entertainment System (<a href="images/ninjagaiden.jpg" data-lightbox="ninjagaiden">Cover art</a>). He was created in 1994 when I, the artist Michael Nguyen (<a href="https://spiritsoftheuniverse.github.io/michaelnguyenart">Visit the site</a>) was in 6th grade (<a href="images/classpicture.jpg" data-lightbox="classpicture">Photo</a>).</p>
                <p>
                        Originally a comic book zine character of light-hearted gore and violence, Kill is now seen in original works, art prints, apparel, and his own video game called &quot;Kill&quot;. 
                        While still light-heartedly violent in nature, Kill is also represented in cultural mingling and studies of humanity. He is a catalyst for art which reflects those who are a part of my life.

                        Have you seen the Kill <a href="javascript:void(0)" id="artclick">Art</a>? Have you read the video game's <a href="javascript:void(0)" id="whitepaperclick">White Paper</a>? Do you like what you see and hear? If so, you have great taste. Knowing that, perhaps it would be a thing to visit the <a href="javascript:void(0)" id="shopclick">Shop</a> and pick something up for yourself and your loved ones. If you have already bought everything out, then perhaps you would like to go above and beyond the ordinary and support all of Kill's projects by providing one time donations or even subscribing to Michael's Patreon, the Treehouse Studio, where you can get the exclusive scoop on everything happening. At the Treehouse Studio we have general chat as well as one dedicated to Kill so that you can learn how to hit super-human levels or just share your clips on how you choose to play it, because that's what it's all about, doing it how we want to do it. Our activities at Patreon are shared to the world on Youtube in our Campfire community videos. We're all about having a great time while learning and expressing ourselves through creativity of art and play.

                <p class="phead">Introduction </p>
                <p class="pindent">Kill the video game is a single player adventure from the classic 2d side view perspective. It is a transgressive piece of art that works against the regressions and trends of commercial video games.</p>
                
                <p class="phead">Player Execution </p>
                <p class="pindent">At the height of gaming from a standpoint of technical play, there was congruency between beauty and difficulty of execution. Execution refers to your technical ability of pressing buttons in order to perform the actions that appear on the screen. It is similar to guitar playing, where it requires an adequate amount of finger dexterity to gracefully articulate sound. Commercial games have adopted the concept shoe-horning the spectacle in place of skill based button pressing. This involves making visually pleasing activity easy to do. Figure skating requires vigorous practice to become an olympian level competitor. When practice is taken out of a video game, people take for granted what they're seeing and doing. It is already difficult enough to get people to acknowledge that you can be a graceful mental athlete in the world of gaming, but the modern take on the spectacle has made it impossible to take it seriously due to the activity becoming more superficial. 
                </p>
                <p class="pindent">
                People who understand the beauty of technical execution pay their respect to those who can do it. Among the entire population of gamers, the ones who understand it the most are the Marvel and Capcom fighting game community (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unt0ivAkV7c">video</a>). That is why I paid my respects to them in full before nomadically roaming back to my artistic endeavors. They are otherwise unknown to the gaming population at large despite being the most gifted players in the fighting game community. This is sadly due to the fact that player execution is not of anyone's concern except for some of them and myself.
                </p>
                <p class="phead">Controls</p>
                <p class="pindent">
                       Kill is not fundamentally hard to control. Timing discrepencies is where the difficulty factor is. It strikes a balance between being inviting to new players while also having something to strive for. Kill is not exactly unique when it comes to his controls. Much of what he does is seen in other video games. On the other hand, he can transition from one ability to the next seamlessly, moreso than any other character in video game history. This is what I would consider the final stage of 2d combat and maneuverability. This allows for the variance that is required for players to be able to express themselves in the world without limits. These abilities have been fine tuned across multiple game builds for over a decade at this point.
                </p>
                
                <p class="phead">Intent of Play</p>
                <p class="pindent">
                        While it is up to you to determine what playing means to you, the intent of the game is not to provide an escape. I believe that the more you are present with the activity, the more you can get out of it, and that is true for anything. Higher skilled players will be able to find enjoyment in the technical play aspects of the game. It is important that this kind of play exists, because video games are now inadvertently exclusionary to these kinds of players. We are unacknowledged with a care and concern. Games that are difficult to arrive at the win condition are not what I am talking about when it comes to skilled play. What I am emphasizing in the development of this game is the ability to express yourself gracefully through your movements and your offensive capabilities, whether the opponent or obstacle you are facing is challenging or not. There are moments where you may need skills to overcome the difficulty of resistance, although the emphasis is on the skills of overcoming difficulty in execution so that you can express yourself gracefully and non-superficially.
                </p>
                <p class="pindent">
                        The game is intended to be played in perpetuity just like the way I play the same games over and over again to no end. Some titles are timeless like Chess due to variance in play scenarios and available options. The art and activity of juggling opponents in the air or acutely finessing your maneuverability through a dire obstacle is entirely optional. There are no rewards for doing it, nor are there any numerical counters to tell you how many hits you did before you drop your opponent. There is no score keeping on the heads up display.
                </p>
                <p class="pindent">
                         There is no end goal to the game. When you leave an area and come back, everything is reset as if nothing ever happened so that you can further experiment with your gameplay curiosities.The point is to provide a playground for those who are curious to play. It does not demand that you accomplish anything at all. You can see much of the world without defeating anyone or completing a challenging obstacle. While this game gives you the option to play with finesse, you can enjoy the sights of its universe without any technical ability at all as long as you don't wander into a dangerous place.

                <p class="phead">Reflections of Life</p>
                <p class="pindent">
                        To some degree, everything we create reflects life in some sort of way. The 2d side view is abstract, so turning it into a dreamscape makes more sense than trying to bring logicality to it. Within this dreamscape are intermittent areas of intimate moments. The game starts off in a foresty area with a tree house and campfire. This area represents my online establishment at Patreon, the Treehouse Studio (<a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/michaelsArtwork">Visit Patreon</a>), being the place where I share creative progress to my audience. The campfire represents my youtube productions where I sit beside you and provide life stories, updates on what is going on, while also highlighting any community activities which have happened since the last campfire video. Having the treehouse and the campfire in the Kill video game allows me to playfully show the game off in my youtube videos within context.
                </p>
                <p class="pindent">
                        The game is not narratively driven. instead, the spirit of the people in my life are drawn into the game. A curious example would be the Marvel vs. Capcom player Ch0l0Maquiner0. Aside from being a fighting game player, he went to a Metallica concert with another player named mrfreeze360. Ch0l0Maquiner0's name roughly translates to indigenous machinist, so in Kill's universe, there will surely be a hispanic machinist out there listening to metal with his friend who can cast ice magic. I do not know Ch0l0Maquiner0 personally, but it does not take away from his influence. Not only is it a thing to include people who have been a part of my life, I am always seeking the opportunity to enlighten myself to any degree about various cultures and sub-cultures. This allows me to colorize my art with subject matter closer to reality, in turn colorizing the personalities of the inhabitants within the Kill Universe.

                <p class="phead">Place in the Market</p>
                <p class="pindent">
                        As Kill is not intended to be a commercial game, it will not be released like a commercial video game. There might just be a playable build distributed in secret at any time. There will be no early access. There will be no play testing. The game just is. As there is no destined end to the game, there is no intention to end the development of the game either. As a result, marketing campaigns and related products can be created in perpetuity. This is in essence to the longevity of the Kill character, as he is now 30 years old as of 12/14/2024, the day in which this paper concluded its writing.

                        This project walks the line between personal and professional. It has fun taking itself very seriously. It's a game designed to let the player be very serious about the fun they have, while at the same time celebrating the lives of the world's people and our cultures, as well as the history of video games and other forms of media created by us.
